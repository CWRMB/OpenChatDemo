# OpenChatDemo
A proof of concept design of Java socket programming

In this repository we can see two files have been uploaded called client and server. 
These two files are the basic starting point for creating this chatting application. The way to compile and run it 
is using one of Java’s latest long term support (LTS) JDK’s which is currently Java 17. Running with a compiler and text 
editor we can see a simple connection between client and server. 
You can then type words into the console through the client which the server will then receive.
